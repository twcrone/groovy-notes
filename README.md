Groovy Notes
============

Ever had short bursts of 'lovey' feelings for your significant other only to
annoy her by 'over' loving her with compliments and sappy comments?

I created this app to capture some of those moments to be randomly distributed
across time in text and email messages that will hopefully be sent when I
haven't been as lovey and perhaps even at a moment when my wife is mad or
annoyed with me.  This isn't subterfuge.  She knows messages from this app
were written at an earlier point in time which she can see on the front end.

Basically it stores very small lovey messages that are then randomly sent at
various points in the day on random days.  So messages don't come extremely
often but hopefully they come at a good time.

Regardless, creating this app for my wife's 40th birthday scored me points and
it keeps scoring with me doing nothing but occasionally putting in a love note.

If you are interested in being included, please email and we can see what we
can do.
